Algorithm Mastery with Kadane's Algorithm
Learned about Kadane's algorithm, a dynamic programming technique used to efficiently solve the maximum subarray problem. The problem involves finding the contiguous subarray within an array of integers that has the largest sum.

java
Copy code
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
         int max=Integer.MIN_VALUE,sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++)
        {
            sum=sum+nums[i];
            if(sum>max){
                max=sum;
            }
            if(sum<0)
            {
                sum=0;
            }
            
        }
        return max;
    }
}
Implemented Kadane's algorithm in Java to effectively iterate through the given integer array (nums) and find the subarray with the maximum sum. The logic involves maintaining a running sum (sum) and updating the max variable whenever a new maximum sum is encountered. Additionally, if the running sum becomes negative, it resets to 0, as the negative sum won't contribute to the maximum subarray.

Web Development Progress
Dedicated time to improve the personal portfolio website by creating a homepage layout that introduces visitors to my work through an introduction, blog section, and clear contact information.

Flutter Exploration for Mobile App Development
Commenced learning Flutter, focusing on foundational elements such as widgets and text styling:

Widgets Overview:
StatelessWidget: Understood its immutability during its lifecycle, demonstrated by examples like Container, Text, and Icon.
StatefulWidget: Grasped its capacity to change state, exemplified by widgets like TextField, ListView, and AnimatedContainer. Recognized the role of setState() in triggering rebuilds upon state changes.
Layout Widgets: Explored widgets for arranging and composing UI components such as Row, Column, Stack, Flex, Expanded, and Padding.
Material Design Widgets: Recognized widgets adhering to Material Design guidelines, including AppBar, SnackBar, FloatingActionButton, and BottomNavigationBar.
Cupertino Widgets: Discovered widgets aligning with iOS design principles like CupertinoNavigationBar, CupertinoButton, and CupertinoPicker.
Custom Widgets: Understood the creation of reusable and custom components tailored to specific application requirements.
Text Styling in Flutter:
Delved into modifying text appearance using TextStyle in Flutter, altering properties like font size, weight, style, color, decoration, spacing, and font family. Presented an example demonstrating text styling within a Text widget in Dart.
